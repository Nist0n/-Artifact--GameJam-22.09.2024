    description: 'There are several ways to spawn particles, and when dealing with
      strips, this can have some implications for how you need to set up your VFX.
      This example illustrates how to circumvent the usual limitation that only permits
      the creation of one strip per Parent''s particle when dealing with trigger
      events. Each headphone jack is made of a particle mesh and spawns particles
      along its path. '
