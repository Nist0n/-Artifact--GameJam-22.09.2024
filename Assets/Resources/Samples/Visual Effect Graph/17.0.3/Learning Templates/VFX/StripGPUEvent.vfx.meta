    description: "There are several ways to spawn particles, and when dealing with
      strips, this can have some implications for how you need to set up your VFX.
      Using GPU trigger events is often the most straightforward way of creating
      strips. This example shows an example of a growing mushroom's VFX, with the
      mushroom\u2019s hat being particle meshes and the mushroom\u2019s foot made
      with particle strips."
